# Lambda Risk Scoring Architecture Overview

## 1. System Objective

The **Lambda Risk Scoring System** is designed to process streaming or batched event data in near real-time to compute risk scores and persist the results in Redshift. This enables efficient fraud detection, anomaly monitoring, and operational reporting across various domains including finance, content moderation, and logistics.

## 3. Components Breakdown

### A. Event Sources

* Webhooks, APIs, mobile apps, or transactional systems emit events with user or transaction metadata.
* Format: JSON or Avro records

### B. AWS Lambda (Risk Scoring)

* **Trigger:** AWS EventBridge, S3 (batched), or Kinesis Data Firehose
* **Steps:**

  1. **Extract:** Parse JSON input
  2. **Transform:** Clean data, derive fields (velocity, geo-distance, behavioral flags)
  3. **Score:** Apply rule-based or ML scoring logic (e.g., Logistic Regression coefficients)
  4. **Load:** Insert record into Redshift with computed risk score and metadata
  5. **Store:** Save backup copy to S3 for audit
* **Dependencies:** psycopg2 for Redshift, boto3 for S3
* **Monitoring:** CloudWatch logs and error metrics

### C. Amazon Redshift

* **Schema:** `risk_events(event_id, user_id, timestamp, score, geo_flag, velocity_flag, ...)`
* **Indexes:** Distribution key on `user_id` or `event_id`
* **Usage:** Queried by fraud teams, analysts, dashboards

### D. Amazon S3

* Used for:

  * Archival of raw and enriched events
  * Reprocessing older data

### E. Monitoring / Alerting

* **CloudWatch:**

  * Track Lambda duration, failure rates
  * Create alarms on abnormal latencies
* **Dead-letter Queues:** Capture malformed records

## 4. Data Flow Example

1. **User places high-value order** via web app
2. Webhook triggers **Lambda**
3. Lambda parses user metadata, geolocation, and historical transaction frequency
4. Computes **risk score = 0.82** based on heuristics
5. Inserts result into **Redshift** and stores copy in **S3**
6. **Dashboard updates** with flagged transactions

---

## 5. Security & Governance

* **IAM Roles:** Principle of least privilege for Lambda, S3, Redshift
* **PII Encryption:** Redshift column-level encryption, KMS-managed keys
* **Audit Trail:** Logged in CloudWatch + S3 versioning
* **Data Quality:** Schema validation, error logging, and fallback defaults

---

## 6. Scalability Considerations

* **Concurrency:** Lambda concurrency limits configured
* **Throughput:** Batch ingest with buffering (S3 or Kinesis)
* **Fault Tolerance:** Retry logic, S3 backup, dead-letter queues
* **Extensibility:** Plug-in additional scoring models (XGBoost, Sagemaker endpoints)

---

## 7. Optional Enhancements

* **Model Registry Integration:** SageMaker Model Registry for version control
* **ML Feature Store:** Centralize features for reuse
* **Streaming Architecture:** Use Kinesis + Lambda for near real-time pipelines
* **Metadata Cataloging:** Integrate with AWS Glue Data Catalog

---

## 8. Benefits

* Rapid scoring at scale with serverless infrastructure
* Real-time fraud detection + historical analysis
* Highly auditable and fault-tolerant design
* Elastic compute without managing servers

---

## 9. Conclusion

This Lambda-based architecture provides a flexible, auditable, and real-time risk scoring system that scales across use cases like fraud detection, logistics verification, and content moderation. With integration to Redshift, S3, and monitoring via CloudWatch, it forms a robust foundation for operational risk intelligence.

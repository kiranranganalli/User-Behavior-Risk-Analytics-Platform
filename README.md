# 🛡️ Content Moderation Workflow Optimizer

A scalable data engineering project that simulates and optimizes the routing of user-generated content through a virtual network of content moderators, enabling high-throughput, cost-effective, and quality-driven moderation workflows. This system was designed to replicate real-world challenges of modern moderation pipelines such as reviewer load balancing, latency minimization, cost tracking, and quality monitoring.

## 📌 Project Summary

This project simulates the routing and processing of content through a distributed content moderation system, much like those used by social media platforms, e-commerce communities, or knowledge platforms (e.g., Reddit, Amazon, YouTube). The solution includes:

- A graph-based simulator that models how content is routed to human moderators
- A robust ETL pipeline that transforms review logs into analytical datasets
- A structured Redshift-based warehouse schema for querying historical moderation performance
- A dashboard description that highlights how real-time content moderation metrics can be visualized

The project is a perfect demonstration of core data engineering capabilities including distributed design, data modeling, ETL development, monitoring, and optimization.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Modern platforms ingest millions of pieces of user-generated content daily. This content must be moderated based on platform policies — for appropriateness, accuracy, and safety. Manual assignment of content to moderators creates inefficiencies due to inconsistent routing, unbalanced workloads, and suboptimal cost structures.

**Challenges:**
- Unbalanced load across moderators
- High review latency
- Inconsistent review quality
- Difficulty in analyzing cost-to-serve and reviewer performance
- Lack of unified data modeling and real-time observability

## 🎯 Objectives

This project addresses these challenges through a scalable simulation + analytics system:

- **Simulate** dynamic routing of incoming content to moderators using graph algorithms
- **Track** metrics like latency, accuracy, cost per review, and moderator throughput
- **Ingest** simulation logs and structure them using an ETL pipeline
- **Store** cleaned and modeled data in a Redshift warehouse for analytics
- **Visualize** moderation KPIs to aid decision-making and resource planning
